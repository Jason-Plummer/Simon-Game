# Simon-Game
The game will flash color and make a sound. Upon successfully selecting the color chosen by the game, another color will be added which will flash, then the entire pattern must be recalled and input. This will continue until the user selects a color that doesn't line up with the pattern created by the game. The main goal of making this project was to familiarize myself with JQuery and event listeners.
